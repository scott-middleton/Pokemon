### Senior Android Developer Test Project

This is a development task for a Senior Android developer role at Zap-Map. If you have any questions, please email benrosen@zap-map.com.

## The task

A junior  developer wrote a Pokemon app according to the [requirements (described in a following section)](#the-pokemon-app-requirements).

Whilst the app is functional, it is not written in a way that is testable or flexible for future changes.

We would like you to try and improve it by doing the following:

**We completely understand if you do not have time to complete everything, if there was anything you would have done if you had more time, please document it.**

- Make sure all requirements are met correctly, and fix any issues found.
- Refactor the code so it is clean and testable.
- Make sure the code is written so that in the future, we could easily switch to use different 3rd party libraries.
- Make sure the code is written so that in the future, we could easily add a database backup for the Pokemon data.
- Add unit tests, the higher the coverage the better.
- Bonus: make sure the code is written so that the list and details code don't know about each other.
- Document the approach to your changes, and anything else you would change if you had more time.

Rules:

- Don't change any code in the zoogle_analytics package
- Don't add any more functionality, we want the code to be ready for more features, but not for them to be added.
- Keep using the traditional View System. No need for Jetpack Compose in this project

## The Pokemon App Requirements

I would like to be presented with a list of Pokemon names from the https://pokeapi.co/ API and be able to find out some details about them. The API does not require an API key.

**Note, please capitalise the `name` values in the JSON rather than fetching the localised version.**

## Summary of Changes

This update addresses several issues in the original codebase and implements best practices for a more organized, maintainable, and efficient app. The following improvements have been made:

Paging Library: The use of Android's Paging Library has been introduced to handle the loading and display of data in a more efficient manner. This eliminates the need for manual scroll listeners.

Repository Pattern: The repository pattern has been implemented with a PokemonRepository interface and a PokemonRepositoryImpl class. This abstraction improves modularity and testability while making it easier to switch between different data sources and would gracefully support a local data source.

ViewModels: ViewModels (PokemonListViewModel and PokemonDetailViewModel) have been introduced to separate UI-related logic from the rest of the app. This allows for better separation of concerns and improves the handling of activity lifecycles.

Improved Data Passing: Instead of passing the entire RemotePokemonItem object between activities, only the Pok√©mon ID is passed to the PokemonDetailActivity. This simplifies data handling and reduces the potential for inconsistencies.

Error Handling and loading states: Proper error handling has been added for failed API requests, providing feedback to the user in case of an issue.

Efficient List Updates: The use of DiffUtil and ListAdapter has been implemented in the PokemonAdapter and TypesAdapter classes to enable efficient list updates, reducing the need for full list refreshes.

Dependency Injection: The app now uses Hilt for dependency injection, ensuring that dependencies are managed efficiently and consistently across the application.

Coroutines: The code utilizes Kotlin Coroutines and Retrofit to fetch data from the API in a more efficient and organized manner, improving the overall performance and structure of the app.

Screen orientation: Layout changes better support landscape sceeen orientation

Code Clean-up: Unused annotations and redundant code have been removed for better readability and maintainability.

## Additonal improvements if I had more time

Test Coverage: Increase end-to-end and UI tests to ensure app reliability and stability. I could also test more varied scenarios and edge cases in the Unit tests.

Dark Theme Styling: Refine dark theme for a polished user interface.

Navigation: Introduce Navigation component or Jetpack Compose for streamlined navigation and simplified UI development.

Offline Support: Implement caching and local data storage (e.g., using Room) to allow users to access previously fetched data when offline.

Accessibility: Improve accessibility support by ensuring proper contrast, adding content descriptions, and supporting dynamic text sizes.

Error Handling: Introduce error handling for the paging implementation.

Dependencies: Update to the latest compatible versions
